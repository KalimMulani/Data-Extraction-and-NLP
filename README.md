# Data Extraction and NLP with Web Scraping

This project utilizes Python libraries Beautiful Soup for web scraping and NLTK for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract data from web sources and perform NLP tasks. Additionally, the project incorporates the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes Beautiful Soup to extract data from HTML and XML files.
- **NLP**: Implements NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) using NLTK.
- **Data Analysis**: Employs Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, facilitating easy exploration and manipulation of extracted data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KalimMulani/Data-Extraction-and-NLP.git
    ```
## Example

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import nltk
import pandas as pd

# Web scraping
url = 'https://example.com'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
# Extract desired data using Beautiful Soup

# NLP
text = "Sample text for NLP analysis."
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
# Perform NLP tasks like tokenization, stemming, etc.

# Data Analysis
data = {'Column1': [1, 2, 3], 'Column2': ['A', 'B', 'C']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Perform data analysis using Pandas
```
